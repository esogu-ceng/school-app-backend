3. Open the **school-app** database.
4. Open the `dummy_data.sql` file located in the project's root directory.
5. Execute the SQL statements in the `dummy_data.sql` file to populate the database with dummy data.

### Running the Application

2. To run the application, follow these steps:
   - Locate the entry point class and right-click on it.
   - From the context menu, select **Run As**, and then click on **Java Application**.
3. When the application runs successfully, you will see the relevant output in the console.
